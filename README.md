# tsgrep

**tsgrep** is a command-line tool that leverages TypeScript's Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) to perform precise and efficient searches within your codebase. Unlike traditional text-based search tools, tsgrep understands the structure of your code, enabling advanced queries that are both accurate and context-aware.

## ðŸš€ Features

- **AST-Based Search**: Utilizes TypeScript's AST for accurate code structure analysis.
- **Precise Matching**: Supports searching for specific nodes, functions, variables, and more.
- **Flexible Querying**: Allows for complex queries to match various code patterns.

## ðŸ“¦ Installation

To install tsgrep globally using Yarn:

```bash
npm i -g tsgrep
```

To install locally in your project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shantanu2307/tsgrep.git
cd tsgrep
npm install
npm run build
npm link
```

## ðŸ§ª Usage

### Search with AST Queries

For more advanced searches, use AST queries to match specific patterns:

```bash
tsgrep "FunctionDeclaration[id=Identifier[name=\"myFunction\"]]"
```

### Search in Specific Files

Limit your search to specific files or directories:

```bash
tsgrep "FunctionDeclaration[id=Identifier[name=\"myFunction\"]]" src/**/*.ts
```

### Exclude Specific Files

To exclude certain files from your search:

```bash
tsgrep "FunctionDeclaration[id=Identifier[name=\"myFunction\"]]" src/**/*.ts --exclude 'src/test/**/*.ts'
```

## ðŸ’¡ Use Cases

### 1. Refactoring

Identify all instances of a function or variable to safely rename or modify them.

### 2. Code Audits

Search for specific patterns, such as deprecated API usage or security vulnerabilities.

### 3. Codebase Exploration

Quickly locate function definitions, variable declarations, or class implementations to understand code structure.
